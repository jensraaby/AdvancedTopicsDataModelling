All code requires MATLAB.

=======
Purpose:
We have noisy observations of the position of a pendulum.
We wish to be able to predict the location based on the sequence of previous
positions. We assume some degree of noise.

The two approaches (Kalman filtering and particle filtering) use a dynamical
model (position and velocity/DDT)  

Run the scripts:
kalman_pendulum.m
particle_pendulum.m
